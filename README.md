# Tools

A simple summary of little java tools that I needed over the years. 

## Overview of the Features

The basic features are: 

* Handling paths and easily editing them. 
* Reading all kinds of files (as shown below). 
* Making simple console interfaces. 
* Doing simple http requests. 
* Running command line commands on the local computer and via SSH. 
* Creating very simple guis with swing. 

### Supported file types

* Simple text files (reading specific lines, getting the lines with newline characters, adding lines etc.)
* CSV files (with different output types like custom objects, Map<String,String> maps or just simple List<String[]> separated lines. 
* JSON files via org.json.simple
* Directly reading files from the maven resources folder
